      <div class="md-section-content">
        <p>
          I am honored to lead the Overseas Employment Corporation (OEC) ‚Äî Pakistan‚Äôs only 
          government-owned organization mandated to facilitate the legal and transparent export of 
          manpower abroad.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since its establishment in 1976, OEC has acted as a bridge between skilled Pakistani talent and 
          trusted employers worldwide. In close collaboration with our government partners, embassies, 
          and international organizations, we have deployed over 150,000 workers to more than 30 
          countries, contributing significantly to the national economy and to the lives of thousands of 
          families.
        </p>
        <p>
          In today‚Äôs evolving global landscape, international employers expect integrity, quality, and 
          reliability ‚Äî and Pakistani workers deserve a platform that protects their rights, ensures fair 
          compensation, and prepares them for competitive environments.
